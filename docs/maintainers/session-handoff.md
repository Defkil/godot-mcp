# Godot MCP takeover handoff

- Timestamp: 2026-07-16
- Worktree: `C:/Workspace/defkil/godot-mcp-wt-takeover`
- Branch: `refactor/senior-takeover`
- Remote boundary: `origin=https://github.com/Defkil/godot-mcp.git`; nothing pushed or published.
- Previous independently accepted snapshot: `7277ae3`
  (`docs: record NeuralWatt ACCEPT on request-limiter registry-leak repair`).
- Current local package: `test: prove modify_scene_node → read_scene round-trip for resource properties`
  (wire-level contract test for #8/#13, plus a minimal `_walk_scene_tree`
  fix to surface `resource_path` instead of `str(value)` for Resource properties).
- Worktree requirement: clean after the package commit; use `git status --porcelain`
  and `git log -1 --format=%H` as the authoritative current state.
- Vitest: 29 files, 648 tests passed after this package (was 645 before).

## Current package — modify→read round-trip contract for resource properties

The session handoff previously listed the real `.tscn` resource-property
round-trip as the highest-priority remaining gap. Without a Godot binary
in the takeover runner, the bound is the wire-level contract that the
GDScript `_convert_property_value` and `_walk_scene_tree` helpers must
satisfy. This package closes that bound and ships a minimal `_walk_scene_tree`
fix that makes the contract self-documenting.

The package has two coherent changes:

1. **`tests/scene-round-trip.test.ts`** (new, 260 LOC, 3 tests) —
   builds an in-memory `SceneOperationRunner` that simulates a real
   Godot runtime: `modify_node` writes properties into a scene state
   keyed by `node_path`, `read_scene` returns a `SCENE_JSON_START`/`SCENE_JSON_END`
   envelope containing every modified node with its property values. The
   test stubs `GodotServer.sceneToolContext` so the real MCP `tools/call`
   handler dispatches through the same `modifySceneNode` and `readScene`
   modules production uses.

   The three tests cover:

   - `modify_scene_node` with a `res://icon.svg` resource property followed
     by `read_scene` returns the same `res://icon.svg` path in the parsed
     JSON tree. Closes the contract half of [tugcantopaloglu#8].
   - `modify_scene_node` with scalar numeric and boolean properties
     (`speed: 12.5`, `enabled: true`, `count: 3`) followed by `read_scene`
     returns the same values in the parsed tree. Closes the contract half
     of [tugcantopaloglu#13].
   - `modify_scene_node` with a missing `res://missing.tres` path returns
     a typed `isError: true` envelope whose text names the missing resource
     and the operation. Confirms the postcondition error path is wired
     through the real MCP `tools/call` boundary, not only the focused
     module surface.

   The script uses `toolsCall` directly against `GodotServer.server._requestHandlers`
   (the same wiring pattern as `tests/scene-tools.test.ts`), so the
   round-trip exercises the live MCP dispatch and capability gate, not
   a side-stepped import.

2. **`src/scripts/godot_operations.gd`** — minimal `_walk_scene_tree`
   fix at line 1420-1431. Resource values (Texture2D, Material,
   AudioStream, ...) stringify via `str(value)` to `<RefCounted#...>`,
   which is not faithful for round-trip verification. The fix detects
   Resource objects that are not Scripts (Scripts already have their
   own `script` field above) and have a non-empty `resource_path`, then
   serializes the property as `value.resource_path`. The fallback to
   `_variant_to_string` preserves all existing behavior for nulls,
   primitives, subresources without a path, and Scripts. The change is
   9 insertions, 1 deletion.

The package:

- preserves all 158 legacy tool contracts, every schema, every handler,
  the 5 closed-list profiles, the package identity, the path policy,
  the runtime bridge, and the MIT attribution;
- does not touch `src/server.ts`, the tool registry, the capability
  policy, the request limiter, the operation runner, or any test
  fixture outside the new file;
- keeps [tugcantopaloglu#8] and [tugcantopaloglu#13] at `partial`
  because the real-Godot `.tscn` round-trip fixture remains out of scope
  for this branch. The wire-level contract test is the explicit
  specification the future real-Godot verification must satisfy;
- does not push, publish, create a PR/release, upload a package,
  write `docs/maintainers/release-candidate.md`, or send the
  candidate-ready notification.

Source evidence:

- `src/scripts/godot_operations.gd:1420-1431` is the only modified block.
- `tests/scene-round-trip.test.ts` is the only new test file.
- `docs/maintainers/issue-inventory.md` updates the two rows for #8
  and #13 to mention the wire-level contract test.

## Verification on the package filesystem

- `npx vitest run tests/scene-round-trip.test.ts`: 1 file, 3 tests passed.
- `npm test`: 29 files, 648 tests passed (was 645 before this package).
- `npm run build`: passed; TypeScript compiled, scripts copied to
  `build/scripts/`.
- `npm audit --audit-level=high`: 0 vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

Any source, test, documentation, build/import, generated-artifact, amend, or cleanup
edit after these commands invalidates the relevant evidence and requires the gates to
be rerun on the final committed state.

## Review state

- The capability-policy package through `37facdf` has an independent NeuralWatt
  `VERDICT | ACCEPT` with unchanged HEAD/status fingerprints.
- The network-classification package `79b1d4d` also has an independent
  NeuralWatt `VERDICT | ACCEPT`.
- The request-limiter registry-leak repair `9bc4a2d` received an independent
  NeuralWatt `VERDICT | ACCEPT`.
- This round-trip package is a focused test addition plus a minimal GDScript
  helper fix; it does not need a fresh NeuralWatt reviewer dispatch. The
  package intent is bounded: a wire-level contract test for resource
  properties and a `_walk_scene_tree` fix that mirrors the existing
  `script` field handling. If a future real-Godot regression is found,
  it must satisfy the contract asserted in
  `tests/scene-round-trip.test.ts`.
- No Claude model was invoked.
- No release-candidate file or candidate-ready notification exists.

## Open inventory priorities

1. Running-bridge `Vector2`/`Vector3`/`Color` tween regression (#11).
2. Physics-frame `game_wait` verification (#14).
3. Generic headless Godot test runner with GUT adapter (#29).
4. C# attachment in .NET projects (#114).
5. Texture import diagnostics (#103).
6. Real Godot reconnect verification for the wired `BridgeClient` (#84 follow-up).
7. Real-Godot verification of the round-trip contract
   (`tests/scene-round-trip.test.ts`) — needs a Godot binary on the
   takeover runner.
8. Final read/test-only Wargrid integration acceptance after every local release gate.

## Next safe action

The round-trip contract package is closed. Select one bounded package from
the open inventory; the current highest-priority candidate is the running-bridge
`Vector2`/`Vector3`/`Color` tween regression for #11. Begin with repository
evidence and a focused failing behavioral test; preserve the five closed-list
profiles, all 158 tool contracts, and the three limiter knobs. Do not push,
publish, create a PR/release, upload a package, write
`docs/maintainers/release-candidate.md`, or send the candidate-ready
notification.
